        <p><b>Cattle <i>(Bos taurus)</i></b> are large, domesticated, bovid ungulates widely kept as livestock. They are
            prominent modern members of the subfamily Bovinae and the most widespread species of the genus Bos. Mature
            female cattle are called cows and mature male cattle are bulls. Young female cattle are called heifers,
            young male cattle are oxen or bullocks, and castrated male cattle are known as steers.<br>
            <br>Cattle are commonly raised for meat, for dairy products, and for leather. As draft animals, they pull
            carts and farm implements. Cattle are considered sacred animals within Hinduism, and it is illegal to kill
            them in some Indian states. Small breeds such as the miniature Zebu are kept as pets.<br><br>Taurine cattle
            are widely distributed across Europe and temperate areas of Asia, the Americas, and Australia. Zebus are
            found mainly in India and tropical areas of Asia, America, and Australia. Sanga cattle are found primarily
            in sub-Saharan Africa. These types, sometimes classified as separate species or subspecies, are further
            divided into over 1,000 recognized breeds.<br><br>
            Around 10,500 years ago, taurine cattle were domesticated from wild aurochs progenitors in central Anatolia,
            the Levant and Western Iran. A separate domestication event occurred in the Indian subcontinent, which gave
            rise to zebu. There were over 940 million cattle in the world by 2022. Cattle are responsible for around 7%
            of global greenhouse gas emissions. They were one of the first domesticated animals to have a fully-mapped
            genome.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><i>Further information: List of cattle terminology</i></p>
        <p>The term cattle was borrowed from Anglo-Norman catel (replacing native Old English terms like kine, now
            considered archaic, poetic, or dialectal),[1] itself from Medieval Latin capitale 'principal sum of money,
            capital', itself derived in turn from Latin caput 'head'. Cattle originally meant movable personal property,
            especially livestock of any kind, as opposed to real property (the land, which also included wild or small
            free-roaming animals such as chickens—they were sold as part of the land).[2] The word is a variant of
            chattel (a unit of personal property) and closely related to capital in the economic sense.[3][2] The word
            cow came via Anglo-Saxon cū (plural cȳ), from Common Indo-European gʷōus (genitive gʷowés) 'a bovine
            animal', cf. Persian: gâv, Sanskrit: go-.[4] In older English sources such as the King James Version of the
            Bible, cattle often means livestock, as opposed to deer, which are wild.[2]</p>
